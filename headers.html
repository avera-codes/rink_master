	<figure id="5-on-5 stats">
		<figcaption>5-on-5 stats, General concepts</figcaption>Teams playing at full strength are generally playing at
		5-on-5, meaning five skaters and a goalie versus five skaters and a goalie. Penalties frequently cause teams to play
		at less than full strength, leading to situations other than 5-on-5. Also note that late-game situations with the
		goalie pulled do not qualify as 5-on-5, e.g. turning 5-on-5 into 6-on-5 when a skater replaces the goalie on the
		ice. Many enhanced stats concentrate on 5-on-5 play to compare players under the manpower-neutral circumstances that
		make up the majority of time in a game.
	</figure>
	<figure id="Assists">
		<figcaption>Assists, A</figcaption>Assists can be awarded to a maximum of two players touching the puck before the
		goal scorer, provided the opposing team has not controlled the puck between the potential assists and the goal being
		scored. Unless otherwise specified, assist totals are for all situations (even strength, power play, shorthanded)
		combined. The last teammate to touch the puck before the goal scorer is awarded a primary assist. The preceding
		teammate to touch the puck before the first assisting player is awarded a secondary assist. Goals scored without
		teammates passing or otherwise touching the puck before it gets to the goal scorer are said to be unassisted and no
		assists are awarded. See primary assists and secondary assists.

		<figcaption>Assists per game played, A/GP</figcaption>In comparing the assist production of different players,
		assist totals can be divided by games played e.g. to account for players who have missed games due to injury or who
		have not spent the entire season in the NHL. However, this adjustment does not account for varying time on ice and
		varying special teams time. See assists.
	</figure>
	<figure id="Attempts Blocked">
		<figcaption>Attempts Blocked, A/B</figcaption>An attempt blocked is recorded for a player taking a shot attempt when
		the shot attempt deemed blocked (by an opponent or a teammate). Conversely, the shot blocking opponent is credited
		with a blocked shot. Attempts blocked count toward SAT but not toward USAT. The blocked shot statistic has been
		recorded by the NHL since 2002-03. See SAT; see USAT.
	</figure>
	<figure id="Bench penalties">
		<figcaption>Bench penalties, Bench</figcaption>Bench minor penalties are minor penalties assessed to either the
		coaching staff or the entire team. They include penalties for abuse of officials, delay of game, deliberate illegal
		substitution, face-off violation, illegal substitution, improper starting lineup, interference from the players or
		penalty bench, interference with an official, leaving bench at end of period, refusing to start play, stepping onto
		ice during period (coach), throwing objects onto ice, too many men on the ice, unsportsmanlike conduct, and
		unsustained request for measurement. Since no specific player is penalized, the coach selects a player to serve the
		penalty in the penalty box.

	<figure id="Close or close game">
		<figcaption>Close or close game, General concepts</figcaption>A close game is defined as a game within a single goal
		in the first two periods or tied in the third period or overtime. As teams playing from behind tend to take more
		shots while teams playing with lead tend to take fewer shots, restricting stats like SAT and USAT to close-game
		situations helps filter out situations that skew shot-based data. The limitation of looking at only close-game
		situations is a modest reduction in sample size. See SAT%; see USAT%; see USAT% close.

		elbowing, goalkeeper who uses his blocking glove to the head or face of an opponent, head-butting, high-sticking,
		punching an unsuspecting opponent, or spearing. The offending player is ejected from the game. The offender's team
		must select another player to serve a 5-minute penalty, akin to a major penalty. Further, the offending player is
		suspended indefinitely, pending review. 10 penalty minutes are added to the players PIM total.
	</figure>
	<figure id="Minor penalties">
		<figcaption>Minor penalties, Minor</figcaption>If not deemed a serious offense, a minor penalty can be assessed for
		boarding, butt-ending, charging, checking from behind, clipping, cross-checking, elbowing, head-butting, hooking,
		interference, kneeing, slashing, or spearing. In the case of serious infractions, a major penalty can be assessed.
		Minor penalties can also be assessed for broken stick, closing hand on puck, concealing puck with hand, delay of
		game, goalkeeper interference, high-sticking, holding, holding the stick, illegal check to the head, illegal
		equipment, illegal stick, instigator, leaving the penalty box too early, leaving the crease (goalkeeper),
		participating in the play beyond the center red line (goalkeeper), roughing, throwing the puck towards opponents
		goal, throwing stick, tripping, use of hand on face-off, and unsportsmanlike conduct. Minor penalties result in the
		offending player being sent to the penalty box for two minutes (or a substitute player, if the goalie has been
		penalized), or until a goal is scored by their opponent (except in the case of coincidental minors). Double-minor
		penalties, resulting in two consecutive 2-minute penalties for the offender, can be assessed for more severe
		butt-ending, head-butting, high-sticking, or spearing infractions. See also Bench penalties.

	<figure id="Misconduct penalties">
		<figcaption>Misconduct penalties, Msct</figcaption>A misconduct penalty typically occurs for abuse of officials,
		continued or excessively unruly conduct, or instigating a fight. The offending player serves 10 minutes in the
		penalty box without a loss of manpower on the ice typically in addition to other penalties.
	</figure>
	<figure id="Missed shots">
		<figcaption>Missed shots, MsS</figcaption>Missed shots are the number of off-target shot attempts taken by a player
		or team that are unblocked but do not require a goalie save. They include shot attempts that are wide of the net
		(MsS Wide), over the net (MsS Over), or that hit the goalpost (MsS Post) or crossbar (MsS Cross). Missed shots are a
		component of both SAT and USAT, as they indicate an offensive presence and attempt to score off of implied puck
		possession. MsS is available since 1997-98. See SAT; see USAT.

		the offensive zone while the player is on the ice. In other words, OZ% equals the number of offensive zone face-offs
		taken by his team while he is on the ice divided by the number of offensive zone plus defensive zone face-offs taken
		while he is on the ice. Players with OZ% well above 50% are being deployed offensively, and should expect a slight
		increase in stats like SAT% and points compared to a similar player at 50%. Conversely, players with a OZ% well
		under 50% are being deployed defensively, and should expect a slight decrease in stats like SAT% and points. OZ% is

		the ice. Its purpose is to estimate a player's good or bad fortune, often called "puck luck", during 5-on-5 play. A
		low value frequently portends future improvement in conventional stats, and vice versa. Only a handful of the NHL's
		most elite players have consistently had an on-ice S%+Sv% well over 100.0. Created by Tim Barnes, it is also known

	<figure id="Puck possession">
		<figcaption>Puck possession, General concepts</figcaption>Puck possession is a term that has been used to describe
		how well a team or player directs play at the opposition net, using the assumption that a team possessing the puck
		more would also get a higher percentage of shots, shot attempts, or unblocked shot attempts than their opponents.
		Technically speaking, shot-based metrics such as SAT and USAT are puck possession proxies, shot-based estimates of
		puck possession, rather than actual puck possession. In any case, both literal and figurative puck possession have a
		high correlation with winning and predicting future performance. See SAT; see USAT.
	</figure>
	<figure id="Regression to the mean">
		<figcaption>Regression to the mean, General concepts</figcaption>Regression to the mean is a term that refers to the
		phenomenon of statistical measures tending to return to their average value over time. For example, if Player A's
		career shooting percentage is 8.0% but he shot 11.0% last season, he will likely regress closer to 8.0% the
		following season. Though more frequently used negatively, the term can have a positive connotation if a player is
		expected to improve back to a career or recent average. See plus-minus, see sample size; see shooting percentage
		plus save percentage.

	<figure id="Sample size">
		<figcaption>Sample size, General concepts</figcaption>Sample size is a statistical term referring to the amount of
		data on which an analysis is based. When a stat is based on a small sample size, the implication is that the stat or
		result may not be indicative of the player's or team's actual skill level due to a statistically short stretch of
		good or bad fortune. With a large enough sample size, cold and hot streaks tend to even out, making stats indicative
		of actual skill level. See plus/minus; see regression to the mean; see shooting percentage plus save percentage; see
		SAT; see USAT.

	<figure id="Save percentage">
		<figcaption>Save percentage, Sv%</figcaption>Save percentage is the percentage of shots on goal that a goalie
		prevents from going in his team's net, calculated by Sv% = (SA - GA) / SA. Only shots on goal are considered, as a
		goaltender does not need to defend against attempts that are blocked by his teammates or attempts that miss the goal
		frame. Hitting the post or the crossbar of the goal does not count as a shot on goal, but as a missed shot (MsS).

	<figure id="Score effects">
		<figcaption>Score effects, General concepts</figcaption>The tendency of teams to play to the score of the game in
		the context of the time remaining in the game is called score effects. Teams playing from behind tend to take more
		shots but are less likely to score, while teams playing with the lead tend to take fewer shots but are more likely
		to score. An example of score effects would be when a team plays more defensively and cautiously while leading late
		in a game, primarily looking for low-risk/high-reward offense off of opportunistic counterattacks. Consequently,
		score effects should be recognized and/or adjusted for when looking at shot-based metrics like SAT% and USAT%. See

	<figure id="Shot attempt differential">
		<figcaption>Shot attempt differential, SAT</figcaption>SAT, also known as Corsi, is a plus-minus statistic that
		measures shot attempts instead of goals. While he is on the ice, a player receives a plus for any shot attempt (on
		goal, missed, or blocked) that his team directs toward the opponents goal, and a minus for any shot attempt (on
		goal, missed, or blocked) toward his goal. Only 5-on-5 shot attempts are currently counted. The reason for looking
		at SAT (or alternatively, USAT, which excludes blocked shots) instead of plus-minus is to take advantage of the much
		larger sample size of shot attempts than goals, and to remove the influence of varying goaltending performance from
		a measure of skater performance. SAT can be represented by a differential, like plus-minus, where a positive number
		is above average (which is how SAT is displayed on nhl.com), or as a percentage, where over 50% is above average
		(shown by SAT% on nhl.com). Though SAT is a common proxy for puck possession, it does not measure actual puck
		possession time. SAT (and USAT) are also calculated when the player's team is ahead or behind in the score, or tied,
		or when the score is close. SAT is available since 2009-10. See blocked shots; see close or close game; see missed

	<figure id="Unblocked shot attempt differential">
		<figcaption>Unblocked shot attempt differential, USAT</figcaption>USAT, also known as Fenwick, is a plus-minus
		statistic that measures unblocked shot attempts instead of goals. While he is on the ice, a player receives a plus
		for any unblocked shot attempt (on goal or missed) that his team directs toward the opponents goal, and a minus for
		any unblocked shot attempt (on goal or missed) toward his own goal. Only 5-on-5 shot attempts are currently counted.
		The reason for looking at USAT (or alternatively, SAT, which includes blocked shots) instead of plus-minus is to
		take advantage of the much larger sample size of unblocked shot attempts than goals, and to remove the influence of
		varying goaltending performance from a measure of skater performance. With the removal of blocked shot attempts from
		consideration, the sample size of USAT is slightly smaller than that of SAT; however, USAT takes team and player
		shot blocking performance into account, while SAT does not. USAT can be represented by a differential, like
		plus-minus, where a positive number is above average (which is how USAT is displayed on nhl.com), or as a
		percentage, where over 50% is above average (shown by USAT% on nhl.com). Though USAT is a common proxy for puck
		possession, it does not measure actual puck possession time. USAT (and SAT) are also calculated when the player's
		team is ahead or behind in the score, or tied, or when the score is close. USAT is available since 2009-10. See
		blocked shots; see close or close game; see missed shots; see puck possession; see score effects; see SAT; see SAT%;
		see shots; see USAT%.

	<figure id="Unblocked shot attempts against">
		<figcaption>Unblocked shot attempts against, USAT Agst</figcaption>For a team, USAT Agst is the number of shot
		attempts against a team. For a player, USAT Agst is the number of shot attempts against the team while he is on the
		ice. USAT Agst is commonly paired with USAT For, to show a team's shot attempt differential, or USAT. USAT is
		available since 2009-10; it is calculated for 5-on-5 situations. See USAT; see USAT%.

	<figure id="Unblocked shot attempts for">
		<figcaption>Unblocked shot attempts for, USAT For</figcaption>For a team, USAT For is the number of shot attempts by
		a team. For a player, USAT For is the number of shot attempts by the team while he is on the ice. USAT For is
		commonly paired with USAT Agst, to show a team's shot attempt differential, or USAT. USAT is available since

	<figure id="Unblocked shot attempts percentage">
		<figcaption>Unblocked shot attempts percentage, USAT%</figcaption>For a team, USAT% is the percentage of unblocked
		shot attempts that the team takes out of total unblocked shot attempts. In other words, USAT% = USAT For/(USAT For +
		USAT Against). For a player, it is the percentage of unblocked shots attempts the team takes, out of total unblocked
		shot attempts, while the player is on the ice. USAT% is also known as Fenwick for percentage, or FF%. USAT% is
		available since 2009-10. See goals for percentage; puck possession; see SAT%; see USAT% close.

	<figure id="Unblocked shot attempts percentage in close game situations">
		<figcaption>Unblocked shot attempts percentage in close game situations, USAT% Close</figcaption>A close game is
		defined as a game within a single goal in the first two periods or tied in the third period or overtime. Close-game
		USAT%, also known as Fenwick Close, is considered a strong indicator of team possession ability, and therefore, a
		good predictor of future success. USAT% close is available since 2009-10. See close or close game; see USAT%.
